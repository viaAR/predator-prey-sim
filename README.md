# Predator vs Prey Console Simulation
The purpose of this project is to simulate predator and prey interactions inside of a habitat. Predators (<) can eat the prey and must do so to continue surviving. Prey (>) try to avoid the predators so that they can spawn more prey. The size of the grid can be changed in the `spec.h` file along with the characters and colors used for the predator and prey. The application renders each generation by printing out all moves, actions and organisms to the console.
